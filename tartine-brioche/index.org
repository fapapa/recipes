** Procedure
To make the poolish, mix the flour, water and yeast. Let stand overnight in the
refrigerator.

To make the leaven, place the mature starter in a bowl and feed with flour and
water. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise overnight at a cool room
temperature. This is your leaven.

The poolish and the leaven are ready when they pass the float test.

About 30 minutes before you are ready to mix the dough, remove the butter from
the refrigerator and let soften at room temperature until it is pliable but
still cool.

To mix the dough, attach a dough hook to a stand mixer. Place the flour, salt,
sugar and yeast in the mixing bowl. Add the eggs, milk, leaven and poolish and
mix on low speed until combined, 3 to 5 minutes; scrape down the mixer as
needed. Let the dough rest in the mixer for 15 to 20 minutes.

Then mix it on medium to high speed until it releases from the sides of the
bowl, 6 to 8 minutes. This indicates that the dough is sufficiently developed to
begin incorporating the butter. Make sure the butter is soft and pliable, but
still cool and not melted.

Cut the butter into ½-inch pieces. With the mixer on medium speed, add the
pieces of butter one at a time to the middle of the bowl, where the hook meets
the dough. Continue until the butter is incorporated. The dough will be silky
smooth and homogeneous, with no visible butter. Cover with plastic wrap and set
in a cool place (70°F) for 2 hours. During the first hour, give the dough 2
turns. During the second hour, give the dough 1 turn.

Just before shaping the dough, coat the brioche mold with butter. Use the dough
spatula, pull the dough from the bowl onto an unfloured work surface. Shape the
dough into a loaf using the same technique as for the country bread loaf.

Place the shaped dough in the mold and let it rise in a draft-free place at a
warm room temperature (75°F) for 1½ to 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 450°F.

Brush the top of each loaf with egg wash. Bake until the loaves are
golden-brown, 35–40 minutes. Un-mold and let cool on a wire rack. The loaf
should feel light in the hand and have the aroma of browned butter.

:END:

+ I forgot to add the milk; realized it after mixing but before first rest.
  Added the milk and mixed again. It took a while for it to come together.
+ 1 medium egg ended up being ~47g without the shell, which ended up being a
  total of 8g more than I had estimated.
+ Since our oven typically runs cool, I set the oven to 460°F, but it got very
  dark before it was cooked through. This was probably a mistake and I should
  have followed the directions.
+ A check of the internal temperature showed > 190°F after 35 minutes
+ Used ~100g of dough for a bun, which would have left ~700g for the loaf; it
  would have been nice just a little bigger, so probably use all 800g for the
  loaf next time.
+ Crust was a little too dark
+ Crumb was perfect
+ Taste was good
