You will need 500g of Leaven on day of dough prep to have starter for next time.

*** Preparing the dough

1. Several hours before you plan to make your dough, feed 100g of starter with
   200g of warm (78°F) water, 100g of white flour and 100g of whole wheat flour.
   Let rise for several hours at cool room temp. When it has increased in volume
   by about 20%, it should be ready. To be certain, drop a spoonful into a bowl
   of water; if it floats, it's ready. It should be aerated and smell creamy and
   sweet, not vinegary.
2. Gather ingredients (from formulation above).
3. Weigh 1,063g of the water and pour it into a large mixing bowl. Add in the
   304g of leaven and stir it to disperse. Add all of the flour (both white and
   whole wheat) to the bowl and mix by hand until you don't see any bits of dry
   flour. Let the dough rest for 25–40 minutes for autolyse.
4. After the resting period, add the 38g of salt and remaining 76g of water.
   Incorporate the salt by squeezing the dough through your fingers. The dough
   will first break apart and will then re-form. Fold the dough over itself and
   transfer to a small, clear container. Bulk fermentation has begun and should
   take 3-4 hours, during which you will perform folds as described below.
5. During the first two hours of bulk fermentation, give the dough one turn
   every twenty minutes. During the third hour the dough will be aerated with
   gas; you should turn the dough more gently to prevent pressing gas out of the
   dough.

   *To do a turn* dip one hand in water to prevent the dough from sticking to
   you, and then grab the underside of the dough, stretch it up, and fold back
   over the rest of the dough. Repeat two to three times so that all the dough
   gets evenly developed. This is considered one turn.

   By the end of the third hour, the dough will feel aerated and softer. A
   well-developed dough is more cohesive and releases from the sides of the bowl
   when you do the turns.The ridges left by the turns will hold their shape for
   a few minutes. You will see a 20–30% increase in volume. More air bubbles
   will form along the sides of the container. These are all signs that the
   dough is ready to be divided and shaped into loaves. *If the dough seems to
   be developing slowly, extend the bulk fermentation time. Watch your dough and
   be flexible.*
6. Use the dough spatula to pull all the dough out of the container onto an
   unfloured work surface. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and use a
   bench knife to cut the dough into three equal pieces. As you cut the first
   piece, use the bench knife to flip it so that the floured side rests on the
   work surface. Repeat for the remaining two pieces. Fold the cut side of each
   piece of dough onto itself so that the flour on the surface of the dough is
   sealed on the outside of the loaf. Using the bench knife and one hand, work
   each piece of dough into a round shape. Tension builds when the dough
   slightly anchors to the work surface while you rotate it. By the end of the
   shaping the dough should have a taut, smooth outer surface. You want to
   develop a strong tension in as few movements as possible—use decisive yet
   gentle force while handling the dough. If the surface rips, you have gone too
   far in developing tension. Don't worry if it does rip, this is just an
   indication that you should stop shaping and let the dough relax.
7. After this initial shaping, let all three rounds of dough rest on the work
   surface for 20–30 minutes. This stage is called the bench rest. Make sure the
   dough is not exposed to drafts, which will cool it too much. A draft also can
   cause a dry skin to form on the top of the dough, compromising the final
   shaping. You may need to lightly flour the dough and cover it with a kitchen
   towel.

   During the bench rest, each round will relax and spread into a thick pancake
   shape. The edge around the circumference should appear fat and rounded, not
   flat and tapered or "dripping" off the edge. If the edge is flat and the
   dough is spreading too much, these are indications that the dough did not
   develop enough tension during the bulk fermentation. To correct this, simply
   shape each round a second time—which is like giving the dough an extra turn
   in the container.
8. To form the final loaf shapes, lightly flour the top surface of the dough
   rounds. Slip the bench knife under each round to lift it off the work
   surface, taking care to maintain the round shape. Flip the round so that the
   floured side is now resting on the work surface. What was the underside is
   now facing up.

   The final shaping involves performing a series of folds—taking care as always
   not to deflate the dough. The successive folding builds tension inside each
   loaf so that it holds its form and rises substantially when baked.

   First, working with one round at a time, fold the third of the dough closest
   to you up and over the middle third of the round. Stretch out the dough
   horizontally to your right and fold this right third over the center. Stretch
   the dough to your left and fold this third over the previous fold. You are
   now starting to get a neat package.

   Stretch out the third of the dough farthest from you and fold this flap
   towards you, over the previous folds, and anchor it in place with your
   fingers. Then grab the dough nearest to you and wrap it up and over, while
   rolling the whole package away from you so that the smooth underside of the
   loaf is now the top and all the seams are on the bottom.

   Cup your hands around the dough and pull it toward you, rounding it against
   the work surface to tighten the tension and stretch the outer surface to
   close the seam. Let the shaped loaf rest for a minute. Repeat the folding
   with the remaining rounds.
9. Line three baskets or medium bowls with clean kitchen towels and lightly dust
   them with a 50/50 mixture of rice flour and wheat flour. The patina of flour
   prevents the dough from sticking during the final rise. Using the bench
   knife, lift each shaped loaf off the work surface and transfer it to a basked
   or bowl so that the smooth side is down and the seam is centered and facing
   up. The loaves will now rise in preparation for baking.

   Place the dough, in the baskets or bowls, in the refrigerator for up to 12
   hours. The cool environment slows, but does not stop, the fermentation. After
   eight to 12 hours the dough will develop more complex and mildly acidic
   flavors.

*** Baking the loaves

1.

** Results
*** Oven spring
Oven spring was impressive and resulted in nice ears for each loaf at slash
locations.

*** Crust
The crust was thin, crispy and a little bit chewy, with a lot of blistering.
Hard to imagine it being any better.

*** Crumb
The crumb was quite closed, and soft/fluffy like Wonderbread. I would have
wanted it to be more gelatinous, pearlescent, and more open with large, somewhat
irregular holes.

*** Flavor
Aromatic and flavorful. Mildly acidic, but still just a little bit too acidic
for my tastes.

You will need 700g of Leaven on day of dough prep to have starter for next time.

*** Preparing the dough

1. Several hours before you plan to make your dough, feed 140g of starter with
   280g of warm (78°F) water, 140g of white flour and 140g of whole wheat flour.
   Let rise for several hours at cool room temp. When it has increased in volume
   by about 20%, it should be ready. To be certain, drop a spoonful into a bowl
   of water; if it floats, it's ready. It should be aerated and smell creamy and
   sweet, not vinegary.
2. Gather ingredients (from formulation above).
3. Weigh 1,843g of the water and pour it into a large mixing bowl. Add in the
   494g of leaven and stir it to disperse. Add all of the flour (both white and
   whole wheat) to the bowl and mix by hand until you don't see any bits of dry
   flour. Let the dough rest for 25–40 minutes for autolyse.
4. After the resting period, add the 62g of salt and remaining 132g of water.
   Incorporate the salt by squeezing the dough through your fingers. The dough
   will first break apart and will then re-form. Fold the dough over itself and
   transfer to a small, clear container. Bulk fermentation has begun and should
   take 3-4 hours, during which you will perform folds as described below.
5. During the first two hours of bulk fermentation, give the dough one turn
   every twenty minutes. During the third hour the dough will be aerated with
   gas; you should turn the dough more gently to prevent pressing gas out of the
   dough.

   *To do a turn* dip one hand in water to prevent the dough from sticking to
   you, and then grab the underside of the dough, stretch it up, and fold back
   over the rest of the dough. Repeat two to three times so that all the dough
   gets evenly developed. This is considered one turn.

   By the end of the third hour, the dough will feel aerated and softer. A
   well-developed dough is more cohesive and releases from the sides of the bowl
   when you do the turns.The ridges left by the turns will hold their shape for
   a few minutes. You will see a 20–30% increase in volume. More air bubbles
   will form along the sides of the container. These are all signs that the
   dough is ready to be divided and shaped into loaves. *If the dough seems to
   be developing slowly, extend the bulk fermentation time.* *Watch your dough
   and be flexible.*
6. Use the dough spatula to pull all the dough out of the container onto an
   unfloured work surface. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and use a
   bench knife to cut the dough into three equal pieces. As you cut the first
   piece, use the bench knife to flip it so that the floured side rests on the
   work surface. Repeat for the remaining two pieces. Fold the cut side of each
   piece of dough onto itself so that the flour on the surface of the dough is
   sealed on the outside of the loaf. Using the bench knife and one hand, work
   each piece of dough into a round shape. Tension builds when the dough
   slightly anchors to the work surface while you rotate it. By the end of the
   shaping the dough should have a taut, smooth outer surface. You want to
   develop a strong tension in as few movements as possible—use decisive yet
   gentle force while handling the dough. If the surface rips, you have gone too
   far in developing tension. Don't worry if it does rip, this is just an
   indication that you should stop shaping and let the dough relax.
7. After this initial shaping, let all three rounds of dough rest on the work
   surface for 20–30 minutes. This stage is called the bench rest. Make sure the
   dough is not exposed to drafts, which will cool it too much. A draft also can
   cause a dry skin to form on the top of the dough, compromising the final
   shaping. You may need to lightly flour the dough and cover it with a kitchen
   towel.

   During the bench rest, each round will relax and spread into a thick pancake
   shape. The edge around the circumference should appear fat and rounded, not
   flat and tapered or "dripping" off the edge. If the edge is flat and the
   dough is spreading too much, these are indications that the dough did not
   develop enough tension during the bulk fermentation. To correct this, simply
   shape each round a second time—which is like giving the dough an extra turn
   in the container.
8. To form the final loaf shapes, lightly flour the top surface of the dough
   rounds. Slip the bench knife under each round to lift it off the work
   surface, taking care to maintain the round shape. Flip the round so that the
   floured side is now resting on the work surface. What was the underside is
   now facing up.

   The final shaping involves performing a series of folds—taking care as always
   not to deflate the dough. The successive folding builds tension inside each
   loaf so that it holds its form and rises substantially when baked.

   First, working with one round at a time, fold the third of the dough closest
   to you up and over the middle third of the round. Stretch out the dough
   horizontally to your right and fold this right third over the center. Stretch
   the dough to your left and fold this third over the previous fold. You are
   now starting to get a neat package.

   Stretch out the third of the dough farthest from you and fold this flap
   towards you, over the previous folds, and anchor it in place with your
   fingers. Then grab the dough nearest to you and wrap it up and over, while
   rolling the whole package away from you so that the smooth underside of the
   loaf is now the top and all the seams are on the bottom.

   Cup your hands around the dough and pull it toward you, rounding it against
   the work surface to tighten the tension and stretch the outer surface to
   close the seam. Let the shaped loaf rest for a minute. Repeat the folding
   with the remaining rounds.
9. Line three baskets or medium bowls with clean kitchen towels and lightly dust
   them with a 50/50 mixture of rice flour and wheat flour. The patina of flour
   prevents the dough from sticking during the final rise. Using the bench
   knife, lift each shaped loaf off the work surface and transfer it to a basked
   or bowl so that the smooth side is down and the seam is centered and facing
   up. The loaves will now rise in preparation for baking.

   Place the dough, in the baskets or bowls, in the refrigerator for up to 12
   hours. The cool environment slows, but does not stop, the fermentation. After
   eight to 12 hours the dough will develop more complex and mildly acidic
   flavors.

*** Baking the loaves

1. Get your oven as hot as it gets—at least 500°F—with a dutch oven or
   combo-cooker pre-heating in it for at least 20 minutes.
2. In the meantime, gather your tools: oven mitts, rice flour, and razor blade
   for scoring.
3. Dust the surface of one of the loaves in the basket with rice flour. When the
   oven and combo-cooker/dutch oven are thoroughly heated, carefully pull out
   the lower portion of the pan and place it on the stove. Leave the upper part
   in the oven.

   Carefully inverting the basket or bowl, turn the dough into the hot pan. If
   the dough sticks to the towel (if used), use more rice flour next time.
4. Score the loaf. The angle, quantity and patter of the scores all affect how
   the loaf expands in the oven and determin the final appearance of the loaf.
   To promote "ears," make shallow cuts at a very low angle (almost horizontal)
   to the dough.
5. Return the vessel containing the loaf back to the oven and cover with the
   upper portion. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 450°F. Bake the
   loaf for 20 minutes.
6. After 20 minutes, remove the top portion of the pan. Continue to bake the
   loaf until the crust is deeply caramelized, 20–25 minutes. If you want a
   crackling crust that stays crisp, it is important to bake your loaf out
   strong—until it reaches a burnished, golden-brown color.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the loaf to a rack to cool. The
   loaf will feel light in the hand, which tells you that the right amount of
   water has been cooked out. When tapped on the bottom, the loaf will sound
   hollow.

   To bake the subsequent loaves, bring the oven back up to maximum heat, and
   return the /cleaned/ pan's upper and lower portions to the oven for 10
   minutes. Follow steps 3–7 again.

** Results

I somehow forgot to do the final shaping of the dough; only the pre-shaping got
done, and after the bench rest I put the loaves right into the bowls. The loaves
ideally would have sprung /up/ more than /out/; this is probably due to the lack
of final shaping. I also did not see the /ears/ develop as much as I would have
liked; this too was probably due to lack of final shaping which would have
created extra tension, which promotes /ears/.

Notwithstanding, the loaves were excellent. The crumb in particular was much
more open and pearlescent, likely owing to the increased hydration. The flavor
very close to the previous batch, even though this batch was not refrigerated.
The loaves had to proof for a very long time to be ready to bake (and they
probably should have gone for longer).

** Takeaways

+ The final rise time is unpredictable; Next time I should aim to have the
  loaves ready for final rising before bed time; Then they can rise overnight
  and be baked the next day when they have properly risen
+ Follow the instructions /to the letter/ to ensure not missing any steps
+ Try to figure out how to set up warm proofing conditions for the final rise
+ Out of necessity, I let the dough bulk-rise a lot longer this time; I believe
  that helped with the extensibility of the dough during dividing/initial
  shaping; to be repeated

You will need 300g of Leaven on day of dough prep to have starter for next time.

*** Preparing the dough

1. Several hours before you plan to make your dough, feed 60g of starter with
   120g of warm (78°F) water, 60g of white flour and 60g of whole wheat flour.
   Let rise for several hours at cool room temp. When it has increased in volume
   by about 20%, it should be ready. To be certain, drop a spoonful into a bowl
   of water; if it floats, it's ready. It should be aerated and smell creamy and
   sweet, not vinegary.
2. Gather ingredients (from formulation above).
3. Pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl, add in the salt and mix to
   dissolve. Add all of the flour (both white and whole wheat) to the bowl and
   mix by hand until you don't see any bits of dry flour. Let the dough rest for
   25–40 minutes for autolyse.
4. After the resting period, add the 109g of leaven. Mix by hand, squeezing the
   dough through your fingers until the leaven is well-combined. Fold the dough
   over itself and transfer to a small, clear container. Bulk fermentation has
   begun and should take 3-4 hours, during which you will perform folds as
   described below.
5. During the first two hours of bulk fermentation, give the dough one turn
   every twenty minutes. During the third hour the dough will be aerated with
   gas; you should turn the dough more gently to prevent pressing gas out of the
   dough.

   over the rest of the dough. Repeat two to three times so that all the dough
   gets evenly developed. This is considered one turn.

   By the end of the third hour, the dough will feel aerated and softer. A
   well-developed dough is more cohesive and releases from the sides of the bowl
   when you do the turns.The ridges left by the turns will hold their shape for
   a few minutes. You will see a 20–30% increase in volume. More air bubbles
   will form along the sides of the container. These are all signs that the
   dough is ready to be shaped into a loaf. *If the dough seems to be developing
   slowly, extend the bulk fermentation time.* *Watch your dough and be
   flexible.*
6. Use the dough spatula to pull all the dough out of the container onto an
   unfloured work surface. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and use a
   bench knife to flip it so that the floured side rests on the work surface.
   Fold the cut side of the dough onto itself so that the flour on the surface
   of the dough is sealed on the outside of the loaf. Using the bench knife and

   developing tension. Don't worry if it does rip, this is just an indication
   that you should stop shaping and let the dough relax.
7. After this initial shaping, let the round of dough rest on the work surface
   for 20–30 minutes. This stage is called the bench rest. Make sure the dough
   is not exposed to drafts, which will cool it too much. A draft also can cause
   a dry skin to form on the top of the dough, compromising the final shaping.
   You may need to lightly flour the dough and cover it with a kitchen towel.

   During the bench rest, the round will relax and spread into a thick pancake
   shape. The edge around the circumference should appear fat and rounded, not
   flat and tapered or "dripping" off the edge. If the edge is flat and the
   dough is spreading too much, these are indications that the dough did not
   develop enough tension during the bulk fermentation. To correct this, simply
   shape each round a second time—which is like giving the dough an extra turn
   in the container.
8. To form the final loaf shape, lightly flour the top surface of the dough
   round. Slip the bench knife under the round to lift it off the work surface,
   taking care to maintain the round shape. Flip the round so that the floured
   side is now resting on the work surface. What was the underside is now facing
   up.

   The final shaping involves performing a series of folds—taking care as always
   not to deflate the dough. The successive folding builds tension inside each
   loaf so that it holds its form and rises substantially when baked.

   First, fold the third of the dough closest to you up and over the middle
   third of the round. Stretch out the dough horizontally to your right and fold
   this right third over the center. Stretch the dough to your left and fold
   this third over the previous fold. You are now starting to get a neat
   package.

   Stretch out the third of the dough farthest from you and fold this flap
   towards you, over the previous folds, and anchor it in place with your
   fingers. Then grab the dough nearest to you and wrap it up and over, while
   rolling the whole package away from you so that the smooth underside of the
   loaf is now the top and all the seams are on the bottom.

   Cup your hands around the dough and pull it toward you, rounding it against
   the work surface to tighten the tension and stretch the outer surface to
   close the seam. Let the shaped loaf rest for a minute.
9. Line a basket with clean kitchen towels and lightly dust it with a 50/50
   mixture of rice flour and wheat flour. The patina of flour prevents the dough
   from sticking during the final rise. Using the bench knife, lift the shaped
   loaf off the work surface and transfer it to a basked or bowl so that the
   smooth side is down and the seam is centered and facing up. The loaf will now
   rise in preparation for baking.

   The loaf is ready to be baked when it passes the poke test. To perform the
   poke test, gently poke the rising loaf in about a half-inch. When you release
   it, the dough should not spring back immediately, but fill back in slowly,
   leaving a bit of an indentation. If it springs back immediately, it has not
   adequately risen; allow to proof for longer.

*** Baking the loaf

1. Get your oven as hot as it gets—at least 500°F—with a dutch oven or
   combo-cooker pre-heating in it for at least 20 minutes.
2. In the meantime, gather your tools: oven mitts, rice flour, and razor blade
   for scoring.
3. Dust the surface of the loaf in the basket with rice flour. When the oven and
   combo-cooker/dutch oven are thoroughly heated, carefully pull out the lower
   portion of the pan and place it on the stove. Leave the upper part in the
   oven.

   Carefully inverting the basket or bowl, turn the dough into the hot pan. If
   the dough sticks to the towel (if used), use more rice flour next time.
4. Score the loaf. The angle, quantity and pattern of the scores all affect how
   the loaf expands in the oven and determine the final appearance of the loaf.
   To promote "ears," make shallow cuts at a very low angle (almost horizontal)
   to the dough.
5. Return the vessel containing the loaf back to the oven and cover with the
   upper portion. Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 450°F. Bake the
   loaf for 20 minutes.
6. After 20 minutes, remove the top portion of the pan. Continue to bake the
   loaf until the crust is deeply caramelized, 20–25 minutes. If you want a
   crackling crust that stays crisp, it is important to bake your loaf out
   strong—until it reaches a burnished, golden-brown color.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the loaf to a rack to cool. The
   loaf will feel light in the hand, which tells you that the right amount of
   water has been cooked out. When tapped on the bottom, the loaf will sound
   hollow.
